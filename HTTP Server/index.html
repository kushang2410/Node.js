            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code
            outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
            scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web pages.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="mt-5">Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. V8 is Google's open-source high-performance
            JavaScript
            and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Google Chrome and the Chromium Embedded Framework
            (CEF).
        </h3>
        <h3 class="mt-5">Node.js is used for developing scalable server-side applications. It is also used for
            developing desktop and
            mobile applications.
